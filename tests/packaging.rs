//! What a crates.io consumer actually receives.
//!
//! `Cargo.toml`'s `include` list decides that, and the cost of getting it wrong
//! is paid after publishing rather than before: the shipped personas and the
//! contract document are pulled in by `include_str!` and by
//! `tests/contract.rs`, so a list that omits one produces a crate that does not
//! *compile* — discovered by the first consumer, on a version that cannot be
//! unpublished.
//!
//! `cargo package --list` is the ground truth for that list, so this asks it
//! rather than restating the globs.
